# Website-Tracker
This application allows the user to enter a URL and the program will display where abouts the website is being hosted from.

NOTE:

This application connects to my MongoDB when a URL is entered and when the 'show all locations' button is pressed. For the program to work you can comment out or delete all lines where data is either commited to or pulled from MongoDB. If you want to use the MongoDB features you can change the code to connect to yours instead and structure your database the same as mine.
